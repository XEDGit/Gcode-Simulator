# Gcode-Simulator v1.1
A C language G-code (file extension for 3d printing) interpreter and simulator, really useless but not a bad excercise for file and string handling. It's my first C project so if anyone has suggestions I'll be happy to read them :)

There are example files in 'Gcode Simulator Files' folder, but you can use the file you want!

For now the script is Windows libraries based so you shouldn't be able to compile with Linux, but let me know.

## Included Features:
  - Frame-by-frame view
  - Pause
  - Simulation speed manager (v1.1)
  - Clear filament trace
  - Live printer settings reading
  - UI with colors (v1.1)
## Warnings
I made this project with no experience in C language, so it is probably full of memory leaks and I've not been following good practices while writing it
