# Gcode-Simulator
A C language G-code (file for 3d printing) interpreter and simulator, really useless but not a bad excercise for file and string handling. It's my first C project so if anyone has suggestions I'll be happy to read them :)

There are example files in 'Gcode Simulator Files' folder, but you can use the file you want!
