# Gcode-Simulator v1.1
A C language G-code (file extension for 3d printing) interpreter and simulator, really useless but not a bad excercise for file and string handling. It's my first C project so if anyone has suggestions I'll be happy to read them :)

There are example files in 'Gcode Simulator Files' folder, but you can use the file you want!

Included Features:
  - Frame-by-frame view
  - Pause
  - Simulation speed manager (v1.1)
  - Clear filament trace
  - Live printer settings reading
  - UI with colors (v1.1)
